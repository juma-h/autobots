# Autobots Rollout!

- I know right? **Optimus Prime.** 
- Now imagine that transformation with the I can transform ya song. Or when the Decepticons do something.
- It can be the villain theme when Megatron come with his 'All hail Megatron'

You get my point. That song is *nowhere* in the movies since it got released in 2010. 
- This is where this bot comes in.
To ask the official twitter page if they will use the song anywhere till the release date: _circa July 2023_
-Every day.
